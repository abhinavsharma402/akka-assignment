Q2. Update the existing Akka program to do the following tasks:

    Use different dispatchers (IO dispatchers with fixed thread pool) while reading from files. 

    Limit the number of actors that should be configurable by using a router.

    Use a mailbox having a capacity of 1000 files. More files should be discarded with an error log.
